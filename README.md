# Spin

Welcome to the Spin wiki!

# Main Features and MVP
* Spin is a classic Tetris game in 3D space! To win the game, users will be required to clear the bottom lines by matching the falling blocks.
* 3D canvas and interactive interface
* Users will be able to use their keyboards to move the block within the 3D canvas.
* Users can choose different levels of difficulty
* Users can pause the game
* Users can move onto the next level by clearing all the blocks
* Game will be over once the blocks reach the top
* Leaderboard
* User can play with one other player
* In Multiplayer mode, users will have the option to attack other players if they cleared 3 lines at once.
* When the hardest difficulty level is chosen, users will not be able to see the entire canvas. As they clear more lines, the screen that they can see will shrink in size.
* As they go through each level, the canvas will become bigger and bigger. (You can clear a level by clearing all lines)
* The project will include a production README

# Implementation Timeline
* Day 1: Setup all the Node module, getting Webpack up and have necessary libraries installed. Write an entry file with basic structure of the game. Learn basics of canvas and the libraries that I will use.
* Day 2: Continue learning canvas design and begin implementing the designs.
* Day 3: Complete the backend portion for the game, and also implement web sockets in order to create a multi-user platform.
* Day 4: Continue working on design elements, and make sure that everything is fully functional.
